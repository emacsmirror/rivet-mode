*** Changed
- Delimiters now use their own variable, =rivet-mode-delimiters=
- Rivet mode is now a proper minor mode, not just a function that says its a
  minor mode.
- Derive whether Rivet mode is active, rather than tracking with a predicate
  variable.
- Don't bother looking for delimiters on cold file open.
- Rename =rivet-hook= and =rivet-switch-hook= to =rivet-mode-hook= and
  =rivet-mode-switch-hook=, respectively.

** v3.2.0 [10-23-2019]

** v3.0.0 [08-08-2019]
Complete reversal of version 2, return to a basis of two-mode-mode, but with
fixes to bring it up to par with polymode.

** v2.0.0 [04-24-2019]
Initial tagged release. Version 1 was derivative of the 1999 Apache
two-mode-mode. It was slow, didn't handle indentation properly and couldn't
create regions which crossed delimiters.

Version 2 is a complete rewrite as polymode, depending entirely upon polymode
0.1.
