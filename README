rivet-mode.el -- Apache Rivet major mode

Rivet mode enables mode-switching between TCL and HTML in Rivet files. This is
superior to support provided through MMM mode since indentation and other
functionality is preserved.

Rivet mode is based on work by David N. Welton and the Apache Software
Foundation on two-mode-mode.el. two-mode-mode.el is copyright 2004 by the Apache
Software Foundation. Rivet mode preserves the same license.
