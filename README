rivet-mode.el -- Apache Rivet major mode

Rivet mode enables mode-switching between TCL and HTML in Rivet files. This is
superior to support provided through MMM mode since indentation and other
functionality is preserved.

Rivet mode is based on work in 1999 on two-mode-mode by David N. Welton and the
Apache Software Foundation.
